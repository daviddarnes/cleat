				<p>Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy, and this is what's happening in your world tonight.</p>
				<p>A La Jolla man clings to life at a university hospital after being viciously attacked by a pack of wild dogs in an abandoned pool. Authorities are still uncertain as to why the man was loitering... Right now it's * in our fair city, and compare that to in the upper Northwest and in the Middle East. Off the coast of Tampa Bay yesterday, one lucky cameraman happened to catch an unusual aquatic daredevil. What you're about to see is a Channel News exclusive. His name is Nutty the Squirrel, and he's three years old. How 'bout that? That squirrel can water-ski. For all of us here at News Center I'm Ron Burgundy. You stay classy, San Diego.</p>
